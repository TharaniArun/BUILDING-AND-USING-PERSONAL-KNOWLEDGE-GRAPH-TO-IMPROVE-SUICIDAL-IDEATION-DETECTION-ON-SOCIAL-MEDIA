# BUILDING-AND-USING-PERSONAL-KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH-TO-IMPROVE-SUICIDAL-IDEATION-DETECTION-ON-SOCIAL-MEDIA
This project aims to leverage personal knowledge graphs to enhance the detection of suicidal ideation signals in social media content. 
Suicide prevention is a critical concern, especially in the digital age where individuals often express their distress and emotions online. 
By constructing and utilizing personal knowledge graphs, we can better understand the context and nuances of individuals' posts, thereby improving the accuracy of detecting potential suicidal ideation.
